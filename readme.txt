DB ROBO, a open source python tool designed by me. It will act as ROBO to manage your oracle database for all DBA activities like monitoring sessions, locks, long running operations, ASM disk space usage, DB size , Tablespace size, etc. This ROBO can also perform the code deployment(SQLs) from the application team on DB . I have hosted this ROBO as web application/website on IIS windows server to server the end user(DBA) from anywhere in your network /internet. This is just a model and can be continuously enhanced with advance features like patching , refresh, upgrade , etc. to make sure all DBA activities on Database are automated using this ROBO.
